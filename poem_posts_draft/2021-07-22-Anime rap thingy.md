<div class="poem">
<b>Anime rap thingy</b><br><br>Falling to the ground, but I keep getting up again,<br>Every swing is striking as I'm writing it down with my pen,<br>Like E.N.D., fire in me blazing hot until the end,<br>Won't yet let my pyre this be, Rengoku GekiryÅ«en.<br><br>I'm so damn evolved Mewtwo'l seem like a fossil,<br>No wall's tall enough to stop me, call me the Colossal,<br>When I'm chilling, villains feeling like I'm an easy target, docile,<br>But be warned, when I turn up I won't bow down, the final boss will.<br><br>Take you out like takeout, I don't even need a drink holder,<br>As I polish you off like dinner; no ice, cause my rhyme's colder,<br>Savour victory like dessert, save it in a full folder,<br>Didn't even need 20%, so call me the ninth holder.</div>
