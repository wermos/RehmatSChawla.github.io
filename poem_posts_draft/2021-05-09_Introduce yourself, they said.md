<b>Introduce yourself, they said</b><br><br>Heyo, folks of Literati, I’ve got words to say,<br>Myself Rehmat Singh Chawla, though call me Bread you may,<br>My branch, it would be EP, my home though, the bookshelf,<br>Now allow me, words flowing free, to introduce myself!<br><br>Incoming!<br>The volleyball-loving weeb,<br>Not tricks, just words up his sleeve,<br>Poetry, rap, stories, you name it, I’m up for it all!<br>But keep your expectations low, I’m in the amateurs’ hall.<br><br>I’ve got no<br>Favourite story, it’s been so long since I picked one up!<br>Interesting history, might feel bland, plain milk in a cup!<br>But words make me feel alive, I jive,<br>This club’s where I’m gonna thrive!<br><br>There’s a bit more to me, I love sweet stuff, and coffee, well,<br>It’s gotta be a little divine for a drink to shine, froth, and flavour so,<br>They call it an addiction, I say it’s soothing my soul, or rather,<br>Exciting, transforming, igniting my psyche of fighting,<br>Makes me wanna pick up a pen, and start writing!<br><br>This is it for now, but it ain’t all, chief.<br>Five paragraphs this time, next will be six.<br>Did I seem too arrogant? Sorry, that’s just mischief,<br>Now I’ve spent way too long on this, back to Physics. </div>
