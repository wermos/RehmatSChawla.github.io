<div class="poem">
<b>Disco light</b><br><br>Sometimes it gets dark at night,<br>City lights gone when I close my eyes,<br>I try to hide but the dark inside,<br>It leaves nowhere to hide.<br><br>Sometimes it gets cold and scary,<br>Sometimes it gets warm and dreary,<br>But I don't mind if my mind is light,<br>But sometimes it's not.<br><br>I have good days and I have bad days<br>There's laughter and sadness and then the sad days<br>And it's been so long since I had a glad day<br>That sometimes I'd rather lack days.<br><br>But these bindings, these feelings, these soft choking chains,<br>Like pillows that crush me down, far beyond pain,<br>Sometimes I can pause them, breathe a little easier at night,<br>If I have my little ball of happiness, my keychain disco light.<br><br>And maybe you have your bindings, your prisons and tortures,<br>And maybe there's no way out, and you're done with being a soldier,<br>And you'd like the ride to end. But I'd say wait till the end of the night,<br>And till then, clutch on tight to your own little disco light.</div>
