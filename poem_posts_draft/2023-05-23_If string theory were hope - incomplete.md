<b>If string theory were hope - incomplete</b><br><br>I dangle above chasms in various dimensions<br>Some strings pull me to safety<br>Others threaten to drag me down<br>I have grappling hooks and paths of ascension<br>Thinning strings urge to haste, but me<br>Iâ€™m staring at the clouds<br><br>If string theory were made of hope<br>There would be particles of motivation<br>Forces</div>
