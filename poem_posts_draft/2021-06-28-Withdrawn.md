<div class="poem">
<b>Withdrawn</b><br><br>Withdrawn<br><br>Words. What a pain.<br>What a waste, nothing to gain,<br>They demand I speak, again and again,<br>It’s driving me insane.<br><br>Spires and towers I wish to stack up,<br>A castle with empty floors.<br>My ears welcome the echo of home,<br>And the smells of books and tomes.<br><br>Spare me the noise and the chaos of sentience,<br>Spare me this farce called society,<br>Spare me your kindness and pitiful words,<br>And spare me your threats to come quietly.<br><br>Leave me alone with my paints and my bones,<br>What lies out the doors you have shown,<br>And I have no interest in the hand you extend,<br>Rather have a lock than a throne.<br><br>They say pens mightier than swords which can slay,<br>But ink convinced neither you nor me.<br>So I’ve prepared a fine end for our tale,<br>First you, then I’ll put myself to sleep.</div>
