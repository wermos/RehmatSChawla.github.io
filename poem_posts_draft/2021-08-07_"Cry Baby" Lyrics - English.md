<b>"Cry Baby" Lyrics - English</b><br><br>We got our collars grabbed and took and took an intense punch<br>After we got beaten up<br>Together we crouched<br>The anticipated rain came<br>"This should clean your bruises,"<br>You lied with a smile<br>Even though you’re bad at arguments<br>So stop making such lame jokes<br>It’s so bad I teared up<br>Getting blue bruises all the time,<br>I cry, cry and cry<br>Leaning our unstable heart together<br>We fight against the rotten Bad End<br>I wonder why<br>The pleasant pain was more vivd, even more than the happiness<br>Clicking our tongues over out wet clothes<br>We look at each other’s faces and laugh<br>The Revenger we swore in that rainy night</div>
