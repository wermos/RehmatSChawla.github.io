<div class="poem">
<b>Shiver</b><br><br>I shiver.<br>Maybe it’s the AC, a respite from this dreadful summer<br>Maybe it’s the sleep I’ve missed, trying to pull me below the covers<br>Maybe it’s any one of the many reasons I’ll give to shove the pain under<br>Andar hi andar, I know it’s fear. I fear the daylight, the chance to blunder,<br>I fear the ticks of the clock, of the bomb in my bunker,<br>The mistakes that might have already split my dreams asunder.<br>The pit in my stomach grows wide, it’ll swallow me<br>The worry laps my feet, rising tide, it’ll swallow me<br>The weight makes me feel like a child, and I gasp to breathe,<br>The fear clutches my heart, I’m paralysed, it’ll swallow me.<br><br>I fear for what I will not get, what I may not do, what’ll cost,<br>I fear for things trivial, and impossible, and what is already lost,<br>But those fears I live with, there’s one that visits, and it squats,<br>The thought of losing more.<br>It petrifies me<br>I feel my heart go cold, and a chill fills me.<br>I shiver.<br></div>
