<div class="poem">
<b>Steam</b><br><br>Prompt: Shattering Illusions (a lightbulb in the shape of a human head breaks)<br><br>With a crash, I broke<br>The whole turning to holes<br>Shattered like glass<br>Now I look for tape.<br><br>Steam blows the paddles,<br>The engine moves on,<br>Seemingly with a purpose,<br>Going until it’s gone.<br><br>Steam billows out the window,<br>Something’s cooking,<br>The pressure cooker just yelled,<br>My dose of life gruel is ready.<br><br>Steam rises out of the contraption,<br>Filling nostrils, painfully.<br>This will help me breathe,<br>But doesn’t give me a purpose to.<br><br>Not to be depressing,<br>But I’ve been seated on a fire too long,<br>I don’t know who put me there<br>Probably I just volunteered<br><br>And to cool myself off<br>I drank some water,<br>Then sat there some more.<br><br>Did you know?<br>Heat water and it becomes steam.<br>Steam pushes and makes things move.<br>If it can’t, pressure builds up until something gives way, or breaks.<br><br>Maybe I should’ve tried harder<br>To get off the flame<br>And use it to cook<br>Something more than gruel<br>Something worth breathing for.<br><br></div>
