<b>Birthday message for Komal Ma'am</b><br><br>Dear Komal Ma’am,<br><br>Happy Birthday! I hope you’ve had a great day.<br>I wanted to thank you for the role you’ve played in my life, through your efforts to inculcate the best in all your students, and through being a role model for us as well. I often marvel at how crucial the attitudes, perspectives and habits I learnt in my childhood are to what I have achieved and to every achievement in reach - Learning Paths was instrumental in shaping how I grew, and I’m very thankful to you for that.<br><br>I’ve written a short poem based on that thought, which I hope you enjoy:<br><br>No plant forgets its gardener’s touch<br>No parchment could lose its ink<br>Like the gleam of a sword holds the flames of its forge,<br>So a student stands on what a teacher builds.<br><br>Once again, wishing you a happy birthday!<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>Rehmat Singh Chawla<br><br></div>
