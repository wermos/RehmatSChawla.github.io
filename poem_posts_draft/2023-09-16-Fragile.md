<div class="poem">
<b>Fragile</b><br><br>Fragile<br><br>I'm a glass trophy balanced on the top shelf<br>You see me shine, reaching high, face etched into a smile<br>I see the fall, unstable, wobble to the edge<br>And it scares me, cause I know that I'm fragile<br><br>I'm a Jenga tower 20 minutes into the game<br>Surrounded by Nerf wars unknowingly played<br>Shots tugging emotions into knots and braids<br>A tangle that pins me to the mess I've made<br><br>Pitiful, weak, I'm unhardened, I know<br>I should be above it, these thoughts come and go<br>But to find me a machete it's taking a while<br>And the vines pull me now, when I'm just too fragile</div>
