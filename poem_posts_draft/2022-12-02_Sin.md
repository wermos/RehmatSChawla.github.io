<div class="poem">
<b>Sin</b><br><br>Sin<br><br>My first memory is that of sin<br>I take what’s not mine, the lies begin<br>My second memory, I try to cheat<br>Take advantage of trust and my smile hides deceit<br>In the third one, I create a facade<br>Seeking good graces, my lies an art<br>As I count four, I tell a tale of woe<br>Gain sympathy for pain I didn’t know<br>The fifth trope’s that I slack off all day<br>And then wish and beg to make things go my way<br>My sixth addiction is to shift the blame<br>Pass the handbasket of sin, and present myself a saint<br>My seventh regret is when I stab and cause pain<br>Then I stare at the mirror and swear to not do it again<br>My final thought, my sins I forgive<br>Then I dream of being honest, wake up, and sin again<br>Every day, I sin again and again</div>
