<div class="poem">
<b>Soap</b><br><br>Cleaning chemicals clobbered into cuboidal shapes,<br>Soaps fascinate me. Some smell fantastic, some fake,<br>Some are things of beauty, clear, or soft, and some are ugly,<br>But they all occupy my mind, as eggs do cake.<br><br>Of scrubbing off dirt they do a job real nice,<br>For a buncha saponified triglycerides. <br>For clear soaps, as I recall, you need alcohol,<br>And for a fruity smell, esters may suffice.<br><br>It’s funny how many random facts I remember.<br>Most of no use to me now, but that’s how memory works, I suppose.<br>It’s the same as how, every day of the calendar,<br>Memories of my failures do my thoughts interpose.<br><br>I wake up to regrets and I dream of repercussions,<br>My missteps I can’t seem to leave behind.<br>And they break me again and again and again,<br>I wish there were a soap which could clean my mind.</div>
