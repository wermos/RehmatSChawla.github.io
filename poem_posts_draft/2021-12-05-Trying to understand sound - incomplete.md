<div class="poem">
<b>Trying to understand sound - incomplete</b><br><br>Sound<br>Noise<br>Music<br><br>Beachside, sand on my feet, I try<br>To take in the salty breeze, spray flies<br>And specks my face. I stare where the sea meets the sky<br>And understand why seashells cry. <br># They cry the sounds which they have heard, or so goes this theory. They cry the way their surroundings cried. We repeat the sounds we hear. They cry because their surroundings cried? Because the noise of the sea is the result of its war with the wind. The seashells war the same way, cry the same way. The horizon looks like the battlefield, or the battlefield stretches to the horizon. Why do I see a war, and what am I repeating the sounds of? Why? </div>
