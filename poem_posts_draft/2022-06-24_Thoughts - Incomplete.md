<div class="poem">
<b>Thoughts - Incomplete</b><br><br>I remember him<br>In every fruit peeled<br>In the chairs outside, now neatly placed in a corner<br>In bowls of cherries<br>In rooms and floors which now feel somewhat empty<br>In the silent TV, and the newspapers lying unread<br><br>I saw the flames rise and lick his face, and all around me cried. My face was dry.<br>Why?</div>
