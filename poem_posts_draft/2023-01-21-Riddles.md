<div class="poem">
<b>Riddles</b><br><br>Seashells<br><br>Bones of the sea, they’ve been music and money,<br>She tried selling them but hurt our sensors of yummy<br><br>Aluminium foil<br><br>I’m at schools and offices and picnics especially,<br>Thin, flexible and powerful - but please don’t microwave me.<br></div>
