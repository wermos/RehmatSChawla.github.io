<b>Can't stop the rhyme</b><br><br>Ayo, how do you do, why am I here? Well, you see,<br>My moods are no neat code’s result, wildly they swing and vary,<br>And as it happens, I got a little whiff of a vibe, now it’s filling me,<br>Call it rap or song or rhyme but I really wanna write some poetry!<br>No, I ain’t got no plans or themes,<br>It’s just flowing words, may be mean, obscene,<br>Or maybe like a dream, serene, who knows?<br>I don’t, I’ve no idea what I even mean.<br>But hey! This is fun, good stuff, yeah I like it,<br>And you know what they say, if the hammer’s hot, strike it!<br>Haters gonna tell you you got exams, the anxiety fight it,<br>And when the letters be flowing faster than the sands of time, write it!<br>Ay!<br>Ink be flowing,<br>The clicks keep going,<br>In front of your eyes<br>Something’s showing!<br>It’s little and small and unimpressive,<br>Might look presentable if it’s dressed up,<br>But pay little heed to the voice saying it’s messed up,<br>Cause you made something, and that’s the first step, uh!<br><br>Yeah this got preachy, maybe reaching too far<br>Into<br>Stuff that’ll make this fall flat, or bizarre<br>But you<br>Know I don’t care much, blow storm-wind or breeze,<br>When I<br>Get the rhyme going, won’t stop till I ne-eed to pee!<br>(Cause I mean- well- it’s kinda unhealthy to hold it in, and it can get pretty uncomfortable- don’t look at me like that, I have needs, okay?)<br><br>Well dang what a fun ride, t’was a fun time,<br>And fun’s my choice of the herbs, yeah I’m kind<br>Of addicted to this, making black on white shine,<br>So when I’m in the mood you can’t stop the rhyme!</div>
