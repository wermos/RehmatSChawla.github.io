<div class="poem">
<b>Night Sky</b><br><br>Night Sky<br><br>Wind in my face, I look up at the night sky<br>Skipping to a beat, like the stars got my back, I<br>Live in a dream, and don't dream of the day, <br>Leave the dreams for the day, I itch for a night life<br><br>Pep in my pace, I gaze up at the night sky<br>Smile to the laughter, a racket to rouse ires<br>These voices now home, and these hugs are so warm now<br>Time can but flow, I belong and I won't tire<br><br>Shivering in place, I stare at the night sky<br>Hands close on air, and I ache for some starlight<br>To shine me a path with less pain and more promise<br>But hope fades away like a star in the sunlight<br><br>Tears on my face, I can't make out the night sky<br>Anger and hate play the beat of my heart, I'm<br>Still and serene, like asleep tucked in misery,<br>I'm punctured too far to be patched up by daytime<br>These holes of melancholyâ€™ll reign on my lifetime</div>
