<div class="poem">
<b>Role Models prompt - incomplete</b><br><br><br><br>Even a red-hot piece of steel<br>Is not shaped by a single hammer strike.<br>And so there were many; teachers, parents,<br>Peers, who forged the me of tonight.<br><br>This oneâ€™s for another bunch<br>Who helped me get through a lot and then some<br>Who taught me worlds of knowledge<br>Stuff others skipped, or forgot to mention.<br><br>They showed me flaws and kinds of power<br>Wisdoms varied, joys and sorrows<br>Their tales of trials and triumphs<br>For countless hours, I devoured<br><br>Wand-<> and water benders,<br>Pet tamers and talkative ninjas</div>
