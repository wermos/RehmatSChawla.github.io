<b>Been a while</b><br><br>Been a while since I picked up a pen<br>Been a while since my words made much sense<br>Nostalgic for when I was proud of my efforts<br>Now effortlessly a pretence<br><br>Look back to a time I knew joy<br>I made verses of words, I employed<br>Every drop of my blood, amongst people I loved<br>Now I speak but don’t hear back my voice<br><br>Back then I was lethal<br>I’d reach for a quill, turn<br>My words into weapons<br>Set scenes for a sequel<br>Now hours-long I’m foetal<br>I reach for a quilt, and<br>I push away guilt, turn<br>To fantasies brittle<br><br>My words are mediocre,<br>My verses lackluster<br>My rhymes like Raye Penber,<br>They go unremembered<br>My work’s nonexistent<br>When it’s not a mistake<br>Even texts scarcely witty<br>More rude, inconsiderate<br><br>Been a while since I tried<br>Since I fought with my life<br>Since I clawed for each scratch<br>Since I felt stung, alive<br>I could just give in<br>But I’m itching to prick<br>To burn and to scrape<br>Feel scars on my skin<br><br>By burdens I’m buried<br>And bland is my brew<br>But there’s jive in my bones<br>And bothers to chew<br>So I’ll boil up some water<br>And grind up some beans<br>Sharpen my blade<br>And be the me it’s been a while since I’ve seen</div>
