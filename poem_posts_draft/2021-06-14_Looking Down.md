<div class="poem">
<b>Looking Down</b><br><br>Sky, bold and brilliant blue,<br>Bright, light, eyelids fight,<br>Sharp, pinching, hammer on screw,<br>Then calm, warm, the daughter of night.<br><br>Leaves, green, swaying like a dance,<br>Ruffling, falling, twirling, in a trance,<br>Then land, nor near, nor far from the tree,<br>On stone and pavement, dry and crunchy,<br><br>Dust, flying, free from the floor,<br>With wind what goes, wonâ€™t come home,<br>Yet rising, dropping, wearing disguise,<br>Shall land once more, a home it shall find.<br><br>Ground, solid stone, soft soil,<br>If broken, never healing, not on its own,<br>If cracked, stepped over, and if in turmoil,<br>Stone pulverised, but soil gives plants a home.<br><br>Hell, flaming and fuming and a fraud,<br>Find myself freezing, no warmth, just cold,<br>I wish myself far, from what lies before my eyes,<br>A mirror, shines cruelly, forces I look inside.<br><br>Looking down, <br>I looked in,<br>And find myself,<br>Drowning.</div>
