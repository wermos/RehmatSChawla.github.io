<div class="poem">
<b>This Feeling - incomplete</b><br><br>Love poems are corny, and the infatuated immature,<br>I think we can all agree that dealing with feelings is a massive chore<br>Love’s childish and inefficient, either drama or a bore<br>And yet I can’t wipe off my stupid grin, cause there’s someone I adore<br><br>I’ve gone off the deep end, must’ve hit my head somewhere,<br>I’ve given up on sleeping, she invades my dreams and nightmares,<br>Every second vacant, I’m wishing that she were here<br>I’m new to this feeling, </div>
