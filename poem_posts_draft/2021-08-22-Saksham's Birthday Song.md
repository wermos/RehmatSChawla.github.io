<b>Saksham's Birthday Song</b><br><br>As the music plays, a figure walking appears,<br>Gauntlet on his hand, his intentions are clear,<br>He snaps, all the phones, they start quivering,<br>Gardevoirs start appearing,<br>He lets it rip, then disappears!<br>Oh, Saksham is his name,<br>Being Spectacular his game,<br>Better wish the Lord a Happy Birth-a-day!<br><br>Oh, oh hey, you Gryffindor, you say? Don't forget, your job, when they "want it, that way" -ey,<br>BOOM, <br>You just ate, but I see you, salivate, when you smell bir,-yani, or to the side, saw ca-ake,<br>OH!<br>Oooooh,<br>That's just the way it goes,<br>With someone so awesome,<br>And you won't ever break, no,<br>Ever farther you'll go!<br>CRASH!<br>In luck I rolled 20, oh,<br>Must have, for you I know!<br>Sarahevir Forever!<br>Cuz that's just how we roll!<br><br>DRUMS START<br><br>Climb up the stage, puff out your chest,<br>Get going, just don't you pause!<br>You know I'll be there, in the stands,<br>Though you won't lack for applause!<br><br>We may be scattered across the land,<br>Or be just out of sight,<br>No matter what, I'll be your friend,<br>And I trust that you'll be mine!</div>
