<div class="poem">
<b>Rap and Poetry</b><br><br>Some would like to draw a line between rap and poetry<br>I would like to live where they would dig the pit<br>I’ll straddle the line with devices and disses<br>Hop over it and back like I’m skipping to a beat.<br>My power lies in my pen, and it can’t be taken from me<br>I’ll write lyrical epics and literary rhapsodies,<br>Something which could be sung to a crowd with a beat, or appreciated as an artistic symphony.<br>As interdisciplinary as can be<br>That’s the only way I can ink me.</div>
