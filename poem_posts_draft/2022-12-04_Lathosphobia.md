<div class="poem">
<b>Lathosphobia</b><br><br>Lathosphobia<br><br>When I was a child, I feared the darkness<br>Open doorways and shadowed compartments<br>The monsters and witches of nightmares can but<br>Touch the fears that now grip my heart, I’m<br>Choked by futures I’ve invited in folly<br>Drowning in a past riddled with flaws<br>I’m paralysed by every mistake<br>My faults are now my phobia<br><br>I don’t fear the ground crumbling, or a blood-red sky,<br>I don’t fear the needle, or the blood, or the night<br>I don’t fear what I should, the hurtling cars or risk of frostbite<br>I fear myself, what I would do if I controlled my life<br>I fear my missteps will lead me to terrifying troughs <br>I fear the carelessness that’s lost me many a night<br>I fear the foolish choices and arrogance yet preserved<br>I fear the devil in me, I hope it’ll go away once it’s bright<br>It doesn’t go away in the light<br>It doesn’t go away once it’s bright<br>I plead it to leave, it doesn’t reply<br>I’m scared of the devil inside<br><br>There’s no one else, I am the devil inside<br><br>Translations: Lathos is Greek for mistake.</div>
