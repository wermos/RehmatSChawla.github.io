<div class="poem">
<b>Yet</b><br><br>I dreamt I was in another state, an intern 'cross the border,<br>Where I kissed a girl with frizzy hair, and split personality disorder,<br>Her right hand was her twin brother, and he couldn’t bear us so<br>So while my right was clasped in hers, my left played tic-tac-toe<br>But something in me protested, a guilt of treachery<br>She saw it in my face and asked, so I told her our story<br>And she said, "But you should be free, you asked and she said no,"<br>And I said, "Be that as it may, my heart’s not let her go.<br>Not yet."</div>
