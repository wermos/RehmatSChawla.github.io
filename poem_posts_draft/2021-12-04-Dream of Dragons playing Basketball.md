<div class="poem">
<b>Dream of Dragons playing Basketball</b><br><br>Dream of Dragons playing Basketball<br><br>Dragons playing basketball,<br>The sun dances across the sea.<br>Walls crumble and rise up tall,<br>And the world forms around me.<br>A dream this must be.<br><br>Ink flows to my command,<br>Fills the plates and water gourds.<br>Poetry takes flight from my hand,<br>As if I the Alexander of words.<br>A dream rather absurd.<br><br>Achievements litter my feet,<br>Victories won and deserved.<br>Yet unsatisfactory,<br>So I wait for the end of this dream world.<br><br>The ink chokes me<br>The sun rises up from beneath<br>Turning to ash victories<br>And me<br>Finally, familiarity.<br>Now I donâ€™t want this dream<br>To end.</div>
