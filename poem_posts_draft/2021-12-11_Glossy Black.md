<div class="poem">
<b>Glossy Black</b><br><br>Glossy Black<br><br>Stare into an empty photo frame, and what do I see?<br>The glossy black is a mirror, shining into me.<br>I see stills captured, of backyard grass and and power lines<br>Of schoolbuses in a row, and a starry night sky.<br>Of booting computer screens and chocolate piles in friendly stores,<br>Of journeys home and finished books, leaving me wanting more.<br>I see mountains with icy peaks and roads of cars unending,<br>Empty pages calling, cameras capturing me pretending.<br>The seashells of Goa, a stunning view of the Dal,<br>Faraway lights through a window on a train ride to Nainital.<br>Views above the clouds and the waves of salty seas,<br>The trees of my neighbourhood, as I feel a chilly breeze.<br>The school entrance towering, and slowly getting smaller,<br>A classroom door open, as familiar voices holler.<br>Familiar voices silent, as others take the stage,<br>Eating, laughing, reminiscing, as we hide the pain of age.<br>A blue screen lights the room, framing faces faraway,<br>Some changed and feeling foreign, some still smiling the same.<br>I reach for the power button, a click, and then I see,<br>The glossy black is a mirror, shining into me.</div>
