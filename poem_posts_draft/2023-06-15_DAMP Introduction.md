<b>DAMP Introduction</b><br><br>Heyo, I'm Rehmat, a Physics student with an year before y’all get rid of me.<br>I’m a sucker for Maths and theoretical Physics, but also coffee and poetry.<br>You may know me through my more popular aliases of Bread and Green05,<br>But if not, pleased to make your acquaintance, I do hope we vibe.<br>You can find me at Literati events or napping in the computer lab or, on a great day, reading manga at Cafe ’92. Treat yourself to more slices of me at the links below - I recommend my website, everything else is kinda dead.<br></div>
