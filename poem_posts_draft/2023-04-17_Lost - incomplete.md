<div class="poem">
<b>Lost - incomplete</b><br><br>I’m lost, my mind a canyon where I cannot find my soul<br>I don’t know me and be some nobody a me would abhor<br>I dramatise my pain - that I create - till I’m swallowed whole<br>Hands reach out to help, but I don’t know who they’re reaching for<br>I could fight through hells or paradise if I knew who I was fighting for<br><br>Continue based on:<br>- Why am I egoistic now, I can’t handle that someone is better or is considered better than me, either of them.<br>- I don’t write anymore, my poems are hollow compared to earlier. Try to fix that.<br>- I don’t act myself, I copy others because I’m jealous of what they have and frustrated when I don’t get the same results. This is very unhealthy, and I need to figure out what side of me works, not what sides of others. I’m sure if I can find myself again, there’s something in there that works. Maybe it’s worth asking to find out. </div>
