<div class="poem">
<b>Nuts about you</b><br><br>Nuts about you<br><br>You took my breath away<br>And left me wanting more<br><br>I'd known nothing like it,<br>This feeling that now enveloped me<br>Overwhelming, it mingled emotions in ways I'd never conceived<br>Ecstasy in what had been, longing for what more could be<br>Passion, nay, an urge to make reality what now flooded my dreams<br><br>You're to thank, and to blame<br>There were days you drove me insane<br>I had you, but it was never enough<br>I always wanted just another taste, I wanted too much<br>Is containing love a fool's game?<br>Or was I the fool who refused to play?<br><br>You were the salsa to my nachos, you made me make sense<br>I could go on with the food metaphors but none compared to you<br>They still don't<br>You seem timeless<br>Maybe that was the problem.<br>You were timeless, and I aged<br>Maybe I just don't keep well<br>Moldy, you called me<br><br>I won't point fingers<br>Hurt went both ways<br>But it's behind us now<br>And we've found our place<br>Amid knives and flames<br>Hand-in-hand we'll tread<br>And you'll still take my breath away<br>Nutella, you glorious hazlenut-cocoa spread<br><br>- Bread<br></div>
