<div class="poem">
<b>Je suis Failure</b><br><br>Another day I spent staring at a blank page<br>Shirking work, then working, losing sleep till I’m crazed<br>Incense failed, instead I burnt myself at the stake,<br>Each day I stab my foot and wonder what it takes to race.<br><br>The night calls out, the day smiles down, the evenings shine with greying clouds.<br>If time runs back, don’t tell me now, I’d lose again to mirror’s hound.<br>I cry to soar, keep wanting more, are lies I tell myself I am,<br>I see myself, a circus show, for there must be few-numbered men<br>Worse than me.<br><br>Only so long can you play dead onstage,<br>Waste not the mortal candle flame,<br>Wax and wane, or set and raise,<br>Choose one, and a higher trail blaze.<br></div>
