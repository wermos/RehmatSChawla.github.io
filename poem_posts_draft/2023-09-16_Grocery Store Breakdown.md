<div class="poem">
<b>Grocery Store Breakdown</b><br><br>Grocery Store Breakdown<br><br>There's bread, and cheese, and coffee, and me,<br>Holding back tears next to aisle number 3<br>Fumbling through feelings, can't forgive the me<br>Who's standing in the way of all I want to be<br><br>The sunset's a poached egg sitting low in the sky<br>But for belle sights I'm too rotten, a little cracked, kinda fried<br>Beats pounding my head, used to make me feel alive,<br>Now just mushy, kinda soupy, served up with some chives<br><br>Tripping on cobblestones, wishing to hurt,<br>I stumble into pizza, some coffee, dessert<br>And the street comes alive with twinkles and glee<br>Turns out I just needed dinner to be me</div>
