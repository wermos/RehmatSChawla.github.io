<div class="poem">
<b>Draft 2</b><br><br>I feel loopy,<br>Going round in circles, looping,<br>Hoops I jump through, that’s just hoping,<br>Frankly, I’m struggling to climb just a few feet.<br>I’m tired<br>Of being trash that traverses tidy streets,<br>Being crushed, I’m draining, splitting seams,<br>I’m wasting air </div>
