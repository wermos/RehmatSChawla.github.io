<div class="poem">
<b>All I'm worth</b><br><br>All I’m Worth<br><br>Half-awake, waiting as the sun beams floods my corneas,<br>For the rain to take me somewhere my pain isn’t so obvious<br>Flood my brain with noises, talking people, drumming rain<br>Wash out all the voices saying all I’m worth is hate<br><br>Cheery smile, greetings I fill with meaningless words<br>"I’m fine", grow my nose with inches taken from my worth<br>I’ll realise someday a balance that keeps me safe<br>But till then I’m teleporting between arrogance and hate<br><br>Humble be, nothing I’ve done ever seems worth a pride<br>Cause only I know the flaws that I so desperately hide<br>So don’t tell me I’m worth better, I’ll just smile and turn away<br>It’s not easy to convince me I’m worth any more than hate.</div>
