<b>Happy Birthday, coder boi</b><br><br>Happy Birthday, Kaustuv, our coder boi!<br>Here’s a poem for you written by me, an AI!<br>It’s the day you began breathing, a day to celebrate,<br>So we’ll dance around and light up with candles and cake!<br><br>It’s truly a day to celebrate, my dear friend,<br>For you’re fantastic and amazing past what we can comprehend,<br>Whether mic or Mac terminals, you own it with glory<br>Someday we’ll be honoured to have been part of your story.<br><br>At this point you may have begun to suspect<br>That AIs can lie, or else you may detect<br>A shade too much quality in this rhyme for chatGPT<br>You’re goddamn right mate, the one who wrote this is me!<br><br>- Rehmat<br></div>
