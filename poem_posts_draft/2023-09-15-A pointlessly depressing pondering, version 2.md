<b>A pointlessly depressing pondering, version 2</b><br><br>Sun rays, and music, an AC, and sweets<br>Harsh, a headache, too cold, and too- well, you know.<br>Dark, nor dreary, yet dull, a bore,<br>It’s a depressing sort of mood when I can hear my demons snore.<br><br>Insensible, no rationale, like a circuit stuck in race,<br>Makes me wanna lie in bed and learn to bake soufflés<br>Hey pretty skies, hey blue clouds, what dulls your gleam today?<br>I’m the problem, it’s me, need me some coffee - better yet, cocaine.</div>
