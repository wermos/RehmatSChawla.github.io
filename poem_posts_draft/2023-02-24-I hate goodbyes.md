<div class="poem">
<b>I hate goodbyes</b><br><br>I hate goodbyes<br><br>Her laugh lit up the night<br>His hand clenched mine<br>We sat talking till daylight<br>And I wished I could stop time<br>Because I hate goodbyes<br><br>Uncertain hugs in airports before the sun is even up<br>Yawns beckon, but we slow our walks till the roads must split us up<br>She cycles off into the night<br>His grip becomes less tight<br>And I hate the goodbye, the closing line, which says my time is up<br><br>So I never walk off without glances back<br>And hug every time like my last<br>And I pepper my waves<br>With "See you again!"s<br>Make the most of whatâ€™s not yet the past<br><br>Perhaps I love goodbyes after all</div>
