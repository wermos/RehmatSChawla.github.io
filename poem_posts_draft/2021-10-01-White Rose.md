<div class="poem">
<b>White Rose</b><br><br>Drip, drip, the blood does drip,<br>Step, step, till your toes dip,<br>Red, red, red as the lips,<br>Which dared to kiss the thornsâ€™ tips.<br><br>Through narrow shafts,<br>Do moonbeams come,<br>Light up, make bright,<br>The white rose hung,<br>I gaze at him,<br>Moon in my sky,<br>As wounds drip red<br>Into my eyes.<br><br>The drips do thin,<br>No life in him,<br>Yet he shines, a crucified star,<br>I stand below<br>My breath does flow<br>And yet, the corpse we are.</div>
