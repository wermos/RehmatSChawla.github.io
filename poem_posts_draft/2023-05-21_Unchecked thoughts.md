<div class="poem">
<b>Unchecked thoughts</b><br><br>The hands of the clock spiral away<br>Like my thoughts, unchecked, but in far less disarray<br>I flip through distractions to evade a void<br>But in memories and music and even my employ<br>I keep finding that which I seek to avoid<br><br>Though I couldn’t claim I was honest in my attempts to avoid<br>Light can’t help but turn around a black hole<br>But there’s no other to blame if I keep turning my head<br><br>I try to live like I’m unaffected<br>But I can’t shield from shots by an archer this skilled<br>That strike with nostalgia for what could have been<br>Hope’s a real tough bastard to kill<br><br>Do I think it through, or try not to think?<br>I don’t know how to make myself be who I want to be<br>So I’ll experiment away as I push through the pain<br>No better way to find me, I guess, than to be me<br></div>
