<div class="poem">
<b>Angry</b><br><br>I’m angry<br>Not like waves of the sea or a dark tunnel<br>Like a dark fog it enveloped me<br>I couldn’t breathe, and then a chasm yawned under me<br>Thoughts enveloped me<br><br>I lashed out in circles all ending back at me<br>An emptiness in my thoughts flashing with sins like fear and envy<br>While the outside me walked in measured steps on an empty street<br>And a little voice prayed that I could walk on unseen<br>Because I didn’t trust myself to be me<br><br>I found an effigy<br>Set on fire amidst my thoughts<br>Blameless, but he took centre stage<br>Because I wouldn’t admit I was not<br><br>Faulty, I see in the mirror, myself<br>Douse the effigy and gather up the straw<br>Pile it around me, and pull out a matchbox<br>I’m still angry, but this, at least, is familiar</div>
