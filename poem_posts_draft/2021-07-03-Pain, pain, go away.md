<div class="poem">
<b>Pain, pain, go away</b><br><br>Pain, pain, go away,<br>Come again another day,<br>Any day, not today,<br>Pain, pain, go away.<br><br>Pain, pain, go away,<br>I can't take this another day,<br>Rather dissolve, turn to spray,<br>Than keep living this way.<br><br>Pain, pain, go away,<br>Lest I solve this in my own way,<br>Blood will spill, my hand shall slay,<br>He who in the mirror stays.<br><br>Pain, pain, go away,<br>I’ll pay you back, loan me a day,<br>You’ll have your fill, have in me faith,<br>O pain, leave me alone today.<br><br><br><br>Pain, pain, with me stay,<br>The sting I do crave night and day,<br>The dullness it keeps away,<br>Pain, pain, don’t go away.</div>
