<div class="poem">
<b>Us and them</b><br><br>Us and them<br><br>My past's split up, and you're in 'us'<br>Part of the handpicked group that i trust<br>The friendships I thought I'd never grow out of<br>The people I thought I'd always love<br><br>Was it naivete? That I thought our bond<br>Would bear separation and silence, be strong<br>Despite others filling the hole you've left behind,<br>I thought we had our own special song.<br><br>Because we met, we tried to reconnect<br>And I saw a face I could not forget<br>But no words did leave with my breaths<br>And we left, nursing regret.<br><br>If there's hope in this world, I'll steal it<br>To hope for longer that this isn't the end<br>That silence leads silence, we lack nought but noise<br>That you're still 'us', and not 'them'.</div>
