<b>The Recipe for Bread</b><br><br>The Recipe for Bread<br><br>Welcome, everyone. In today's recipe,<br>We'll be baking bread. No, it's not gluten-free, Vee!<br>For god's sake. (That's the third time this week.)<br>Let’s begin- No Nis, we don’t need steak!<br><br>First things first, we need a solid little base. <br>Stack some books, and then some more, till you look like a right nutcase.<br>Sugar and water on the heat and bring it to a boil,<br>Add chopped chocolate. Don't miss any piece, you gotta catch 'em all!<br><br>Dissolve in a dash of stupidity and a penchant for all things ink,<br>Cover and refrigerate. Now let's start on a drink.<br>Take two spoons of coffee and a large cup of milk,<br>Sugar and spice, then taste - pretty nice - and aerate with a whisk.<br><br>Grab a big bowl, cause we're starting to roll, add water, sugar, and yeast.<br>Keep it aside - oops, spilt some. Gotta tidy this up. Gina, could you put on some music? Merci.<br>We're back. The yeast bloomed, dump in your flour, mix it up and knead it well.<br>Splash of olive oil, make Ramsey proud, then chill till you hear the bell.<br><br>Get your oven warm - nay, hot, this dough's strong - and plop it in. Now you just gotta wait.<br>We've already made the chocolate-caramel glaze, so get it out and get ready to plate.<br>What’s that, Adi? You think the dough ain't puffing? Worry not, and trust instead.<br>It may look like in pain, but it'll rise up again, and that's how you'll know it'll be Bread.<br></div>
