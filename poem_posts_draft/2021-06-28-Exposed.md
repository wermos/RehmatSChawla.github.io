<div class="poem">
<b>Exposed</b><br><br>Exposed<br><br>He felt as if the curtains had opened and he had been dropped onto a stage, an audience stretching out as far as he could see, the safety of the backstage dissolving into nothingness as a crowd of eyes and smiles went on forever no matter where he turned, the smiles turning cold, turning into grins and boos, shrieks of laughter, and the stage and podium began to dissolve, and he crawled on a shrinking circle of raised wooden floor, while his shame the crowds adored.<br>“Your secret’s out,” she smiled, an imitation of a cruel smile, though she was betrayed by the pain on her face, her glistening eyes. He saw none of it. He saw  himself, hung from chains, stripped layer by layer of all he had built up, stripped of his protection, hung naked for all to see.<br>“Your nightmares will come true,” he had been warned, what a joke. Nightmares were driven away when the curtains opened.</div>
