<div class="poem">
<b>I can't bear the quiet</b><br><br>I can’t bear the quiet, I’m always bopping to a beat,<br>Never sitting still, there’s always more to see, to hear, to read<br>I take pride in it, dead tired but my day’s still incomplete<br>So with lectures as my lullabys I lure myself to sleep.<br><br>Efficient, it’s productive, you know how the story goes<br>Pinocchio to the mirror, I still get a longer nose<br>I’ve tried settling for silence, truth be told, saw where it leads,<br>The thoughts my conscious conjures up make nightmares look like dreams.<br>I can’t bear the quiet, cause I can hear my demons scream.<br><br></div>
