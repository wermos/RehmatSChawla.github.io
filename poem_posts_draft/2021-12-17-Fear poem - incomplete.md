<div class="poem">
<b>Fear poem - incomplete</b><br><br>The curtains fall, and stage-lights dim,<br>The podium waits, I wear a grin,<br>Stroll in from the wings, Iâ€™m at my peak,<br>A deep breath in, and I begin to speak.<br><br>And then I crumble,<br>My voice dies,<br>Stand there, paralyzed,<br>Week knees, blurry eyes,<br>Quick breaths publicise<br>The grin was but a lie.<br></div>
