<div class="poem">
<b>Once more, rise - Origins:New beginnings</b><br><br>Broken and jaded and humiliated,<br>I stand at sundown, head bent, with my spark faded,<br>Body heavy as if my failures I carry,<br>“To stand is useless,” I deem, and fall.<br>Down I come, hopes and all.<br>Among worms I sprawl,<br>The air turned rock, not a gust to ruffle, what peace, I made the right call.<br><br>Yet someone wished for a squall.<br>Someone called my blanket a wall,<br>Wished to stand up tall, loudly call, every challenger brawl!<br>What foolishness, I rebuke inwards, to dream so big when I am, so small,<br>Failure that I am, after all.<br><br>Resolute, I looked up, to show myself an unforgiving sky<br>But instead I saw stars, eyes looking into my eyes,<br>Fly!<br>I heard, soar, in joy cry!<br>But I can’t, claim I, and I reply,<br>Prove it. I laugh.<br>How sly.<br><br>So I raise myself<br>And I stand up straight<br>And straight at the moon I stare,<br>Witness, Diana!<br>My oath to make heavy,<br>The empty scabbard I wear.<br><br>With heavy arms, though getting lighter, <br>Grab the rusted blade tossed aside<br>It’s heavy, I can’t, it’s too much for me,<br>Are just thoughts, they shall be like tides.<br>What a bore it would be to lie down again,<br>So I swing to the ground and the skies<br>And I’ll swing till I soar, come blaze or downpour,<br>Sweat drenched, I swing till sunrise.<br>Once more, I rise.</div>
