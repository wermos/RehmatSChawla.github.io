<div class="poem">
<b>Wish you were here</b><br><br>Wish you were here<br><br>I’m finally where I’ve been longing to be<br>Pastel-coloured houses and cobblestone streets<br>A drizzle in the air makes it oh so pretty<br>And my first thought’s that I wish you were here with me<br><br>I go through the sights and the sounds and the food<br>The buses and cafes and dresses and suits<br>And I keep picturing how you’d light up with glee<br>And I would be happy just looking at you<br><br>I try pastries you'd have drooled over, feel the wind you would've loved<br>Touring spots on your checklist gets me off my lazy butt<br>I sketch your smile in photos, and when I feel down or done,<br>I hear you cheer me on, and you make me get up.<br>And I wish you were here, so I could give a hug,<br>And read you this in person<br>But I guess I'm greedy, I wish for too much.</div>
