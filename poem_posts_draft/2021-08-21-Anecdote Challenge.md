<div class="poem">
<b>Anecdote Challenge</b><br><br>The warm summer evening turning into night,<br>We step out to a chilly breeze as bird flocks homeward fly,<br>Walking to our destination, led and followed by<br>Strangers, who shall be so long as orange streaks the sky.<br><br>We walk and walk, of odd things talk, rid of filters and sieves,<br>A splendid sight, soft sunset’s light, turning golden the leaves,<br>We walk and laugh; a tired trot brings our target in sight,<br>We shiver, excitement growing with chill, cause it’s only begun, the night.<br><br></div>
