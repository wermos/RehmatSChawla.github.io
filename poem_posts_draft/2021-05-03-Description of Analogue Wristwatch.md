<b>Description of Analogue Wristwatch</b><br><br>*Analogue Wristwatch*<br>Something with 2 parts, one part is long, rectangular, and thin in width, and wraps around your wrist. It can be made of cloth, leather, metal pieces, plastic, rubber, or even other materials. The other part is smaller approximately a prism (circular, rectangular, or sometimes even other types), attached to the first part by one of the bases of the prism, the larger side, and generally rests on one side of the wrist. Generally, it has a central axis perpendicular to the larger side of the second part, with two or three long and thin pieces (henceforth referred to as needles), which are attached to the central axis and perpendicular to it, not loose but can be rotated by an inner mechanism. These needles are visible from the side of the second part opposite to the attached side, either attached on the outside or under a transparent cover. The surface of the second part below the transparent part (if present) and the needles, has numbers written or in any other way made visible on it, generally the numbers 1-12, equally spaced, in order, around the edge of the surface. There may also be other lines, marked on the edges in a similar way, often 48 such lines with the numbers and lines being equally spaced. A power source (generally electrical battery) and a system consisting of electrical and mechanical parts powered by this power source, inside the second part and under the surface with numbers on it, make the needles move at different speeds. Generally if correctly working, the needles move at speeds such that every 60 seconds, one of the needles rotates a whole circle, another does so in 60 minutes, and the last one in 12 hours. The one which takes 12 hours is generally noticeably shorter, and the one which takes 60 seconds noticeably thinner, than the other 2. The purpose of this device is for you to be able to wear it and know the time, anytime. Variations of this with the same purpose exist.</div>
