<div class="poem">
<b>Lighthouse prompt - Tower to climb - incomplete</b><br><br>A tower to climb which is improvement, you go around and around and sometimes the sun shines on you, and sometimes it doesn’t. And that’s okay, you can deal with that. But what about when you’re below where the tower starts? You’re underwater, and you can’t breathe, and you’re gasping for air and trying to swim towards to tower. Because on the tower, at least you’ll have a foothold.<br><br><br>There’s a tower to climb.<br>So we do, all of us, we try to climb it.<br>Some give up, rest partway,<br>Some keep going till their last breath.<br>But it exists, so we climb it.<br><br><br><br><br>But I see the waters rising,<br>My position seems lower and lower<br>And I scramble to climb faster<br>But I keep slipping, going slower and slower.</div>
