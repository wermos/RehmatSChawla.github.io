<b>A Pointlessly Depressing Pondering</b><br><br>Heaven turning grey, they frown,<br>in tiny packages, come down,<br>The elixir, sweet and curing,<br>Of thirst. And yet tis boring.<br><br>The sky, beauty unmatched, it smiles,<br>Close by me do sit warm voices and eyes,<br>All the world’s art and music within<br>my hand’s reach - yet i’m bored. What sin?<br><br>What sin hath i committed, i ask<br>That despite having everything, i find joy in no task?<br>Despite being fine, my body, it aches,<br>And my brain has forgotten how it is to be awake!<br><br>Why, oh why, can i find no way,<br>To move myself, nothing for which to say,<br>That i am excited, or interested in,<br>There is a worm which infests within!<br><br>And it’s sucking the life out of me.<br>It’s sucking the joy out of me.<br>It’s sucking the heart out of me.<br>And i’m scared. Because if this goes on,<br>A husk is all that shall remain.<br>And I know no cure.<br><br>It makes it all feel worthless.<br>Worthless -  is that the right word?<br>Is it, for something which never had worth,<br>When that something, is everything?<br><br>Nothing is of worth, except that which we delude ourselves with.<br>And since it is so… Then where is the worth,<br>In this much-touted-as-valuable life?<br>I see none.<br><br>What a thing to realise, on this rainy evening,<br>As the clouds frown and the sand drowns,<br>“I see none.” And since it is so,<br>There is something i can do, exciting and new,<br>Perhaps a new world to see,<br>Perhaps darkness is all that awaits me,<br>But if i leave this world, maybe i will be<br>free<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>And then i check my phone and see,<br>A deadline awaits me,<br>And an enjoyable story,<br>Maybe I won’t leave<br>yet.</div>
