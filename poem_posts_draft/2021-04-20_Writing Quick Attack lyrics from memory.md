<b>Writing "Quick Attack" lyrics from memory</b><br><br>Set up, set up, put it down!<br>Set up, set up, put it down!<br>Set up, set up, put it down!<br>Oh, ooh, put it down! 		(I heard till here to jog my memory)<br><br>Set up, set up, put it down!  (Never stop our climbing cause we’re aiming for the crown)<br>Set up, set up, put it down! (Spread our wings and fly, you see us __ among the clouds)<br>Set up, set up, put it down! (Never stop our climbing cause we’re aiming for the crown)<br>Oh, ooh, put it down! (Spread our wings and fly, you see us __ among the clouds)<br><br>Never step to me,			(Kageyama is underlined)<br>Pumping(?) up in expertise,<br>If you check the seed you’ll see I’m top<br>So never step to me! (Okay)<br>But now the king looking back to see the treachery,<br>If you could jump a little higher you might get to me!<br><br>Straight outta middle school without a single dub(?) to my name,		(Hinata is italicised, combo means both spoke.)<br>Floating high on aspirations and my love for the game,<br>And I’m aware that certain traits have been under-explained(?),<br>Lack in grace, make up for it with my hunger to play!<br><br>Your tenacity is worthless, you’re not playing with skill!<br>I’ve got the strength to make it work- But you’re not making the kill!<br>Gotta break a few eggs to know the shape of the grill!<br>My quick attack is sick! Uh yeah, it’s making me ill. (Oh is it? Yeah.)<br><br>I’m sick of all your gimmicks and show!<br>I’m the only one among us with a critical role!<br>I could be doing this all with my eyes closed!  Then give it a go!<br>If you would listen to me, it would be a miracle!<br>Oh.</div>
