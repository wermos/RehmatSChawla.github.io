<div class="poem">
<b>Random rapping</b><br><br>Cross ways,<br>We meet gaze,<br>No crossed blades,<br>But war blaze.<br>Two verses,<br>One surface,<br>One sinks, and we<br>Go again.<br><br><br>Flowing like a water-bender<br>Peaking, this is my crescendo,<br>Gimme shit, I’ll be your end, and<br>Pack it up, return to sender.<br><br><br>I’m waking up and trouble’s in<br>I pick my pen and struggle till<br>I’m done but dusted, subtle pain<br>I fall asleep, then back again.<br><br>Every day I blunder, forfeit<br>Stuck in debt yet I dream profit<br>Acting like a looping GIF,<br>I get up hyped and fall exhausted.<br><br>Play some music, dull the pain,<br>Drink some coffee, back again,<br>Yell out loud, I show my mane,<br>But empty is the lion’s den.<br><br>Tell myself it’ll take a while,<br>Be forgiving, you’re a child,<br>Face the mirror, give a smile,<br>Staring back’s a failure. Wow,<br>Who would’ve guessed?<br>Dunno, I was just hoping…<br>For someone to save you from this mess?<br>That you created? Caused your own distress,<br>And now you hate it?<br>Grow up, the world’s done being patient.<br>Suck it up, that pain is your creation.<br><br>I was hoping to break it.<br>Huh?<br>Break this cycle of failing,<br>Once be worth creation,<br>And I can’t be an oracle,<br>But there’s things I didn’t fail at.<br>So I’ll yet have faith,<br>And I’ll try and be patient,<br>I’ve still got the days left,<br>So I’ll target each sunset.<br>Make a vow each dawn, and fail by each night?<br>If life were that consistent, there wouldn’t be life.</div>
