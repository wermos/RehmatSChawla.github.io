<b>The meta poem</b><br><br><br>Fake smiles, a face mask, I give a laugh and play my part<br>Blare music, chase noise, to deafen (the sting in my heart?)<br><br><br><br><br><br>A poem about "Iâ€™m scared of not being close to you anymore" originating from being separated to an unfamiliar place<br>Kinda meta in that it uses titles from my previous poems</div>
