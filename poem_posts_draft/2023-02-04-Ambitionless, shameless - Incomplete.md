<div class="poem">
<b>Ambitionless, shameless - Incomplete</b><br><br>Do you have no ambition? Do you have no shame?<br><br>Ambitionless, shameless<br>You sit as if brain dead<br>Nursing a lukewarm drink<br>Pretending to regret<br>The failures you’ve set up and now cascade<br>The efforts so empty you use as a stage<br>An optimist saw what you call glass half full<br>And bought you a drink and left you the change<br>And yet you sit cross-legged and satisfied<br>A husk of pride, contemplation a disguise,<br>Uncomprehending, careless about consequences, …<br><Rhyme with disguise><br><br>Ambitionless, shameless<br></div>
