<b>Half written scary story</b><br><br>Scary Story<br><br>Thump.You look up from the equations which have since evening plagued your mind, to see thunder and lightning give way to darkness and hail. Stretching, you glance at your phone, and decide to call it a day. A door slams, somewhere in the house; you shiver, and close your laptop. The wind whistles through windows, tickles your sides and neck. Wanting a snack, you walk to the fridge, open it, but your half-eaten chocolate is gone. You frown, ruffle through the tupperware boxes, but it’s nowhere to be seen. Disappointed, you close the fridge, and settle for a glass of water. You fill it up, and put it to your mouth, but there’s nothing. Confused, you look at the glass, and it’s dry, without a drop of water. You pick up a pitcher to <br><br><br>Another:<br>The light switch never seemed so terrifying.<br>Turning around, sometimes slowly, sometimes suddenly, trying to catch off guard that which you try to convince yourself does not exist.<br>Paranoid, you lie awake for hours, looking everywhere and seeing nothing moving, and getting more and more terrified.<br>And then dawn arrives.<br>Relieved, almost in tears, you get up to welcome the sun, the warmth, and the respite from the terror.<br>Your ankle doesn't move, and then it does, backwards, into a hole that wasn't there, it gets wider and wider and you see eyes and eyes shining, hands slimy, grabbing your limbs with iron grips, and you yell your lungs out, and no one hears, until you go under.<br></div>
