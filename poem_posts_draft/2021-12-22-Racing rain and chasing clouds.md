<div class="poem">
<b>Racing rain and chasing clouds</b><br><br>Racing rain and chasing clouds<br><br>Suitcases stuffed, survey skies with excited eyes<br>Backdrops bolt by, bit-by-bit bringing ever nigh<br>We travel and tire, with a target in our minds<br>But unparalleled is the joy, of spying a shifting sky.</div>
