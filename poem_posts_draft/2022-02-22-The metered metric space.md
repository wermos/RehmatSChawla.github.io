<b>The metered metric space</b><br><br>The metered metric space<br><br>Might be rare to write a poem merely to prove a point,<br>But I’m here to prove a theorem, maths and words are not disjoint.<br>Manifolds and metaphors, they seem mistakes to mix?<br>My my, you’re clearly new to meters and metrics, kiddo!<br><br>My rhythm is so radical with heptameter lines,<br>Not even the Lagrangian could minimise my rhymes!<br>I'll integrate so many terms into lines two to the fourth,<br>Best hold on to your integers and prepare to be floored!<br><br>I'll alliterate algebra, turn your products into powers,<br>Dual-wield bra ket vector spaces and personified flowers.<br>When I call mugs donuts it's metaphor and topology,<br>My Haikus so symmetric you'd think it's group theory.<br><br>Call me Euclid, how I'll be redefining the genre's meta,<br>Limitless in trying to be the best, so call me an epsilon-delta.<br>My words strike like functions spike, yup that's a simile,<br>I differentiate to the dirac, that’s why they call me Green.</div>
