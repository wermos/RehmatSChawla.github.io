<b>Somtimes you just like the sting</b><br><br>Sometimes you just like the sting.<br><br>Hear me out, I'm not a masochist,<br>I'm not out here advertising eating fists,<br>Nor hurting yourself for the fun of it,<br>But the sting, it reminds you you exist.<br>Doesn't it?<br>Hasn't it,<br>Ever woken your head and senses?<br>Snapped, right cracked, stupor you out of,<br>Wind rushes past, ridding the pillow soft,<br>Open wide eyes, disappear lies,<br>like foggy skies with bright sunrise?<br>Il a pour me, mon ami.<br>Il a pour me, loving it, je suis.<br><br>Sometimes you just like the sting.<br><br>Because this we know, you and I,<br>Without the thorns, the petals die;<br>Alchemy's fundamental law holds true,<br>As you give to me, I must lose for you,<br>So when it stings, I know for sure,<br>That what I'm getting is true, and<br>My bruises keep wanting more.<br>So, mon ami, do you see?<br>Pourquoi c'est comme ça avec me?<br><br>But before i go, I'll leave you with this,<br>The sting may be nice, but not memory miss,<br>A little bruise heals easy, not so the cracks and pains,<br>Of bones, hearts broken - sometimes never heal again.<br><br>"il a pour me" = "it has for me"<br>“mon ami" = "my friend"<br>"je suis" = "I am"<br>“pourquoi c'est comme ça avec me?" = "why it is like this with me?"</div>
