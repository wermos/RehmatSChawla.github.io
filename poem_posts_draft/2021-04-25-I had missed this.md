<div class="poem">
<b>I had missed this</b><br><br>Oh, I had missed this.<br><br>There’s a feeling creeping up my spine,<br>All else but the goal slips from my mind,<br>Vision like a tunnel, it’s not focus, I’m not fine,<br>And yet I revel, for I have a deadline.<br><br>Stress filling up, filling up, overflowing,<br>Seconds disappear, I don't know where they're going,<br>The finality drawing closer, I can see it growing,<br>And yet I feel a rush, the adrenaline is flowing.<br><br>I can’t stop, I can’t rest, the end-time’s in sight!<br>I manage to inch closer, but the distance is in miles!<br>Sleep calls, get some coffee, trying to pass these trials!<br>But hate this I don’t, it makes me feel alive!<br><br>Peace and quiet, I don’t love, being soulless, and bored,<br>It’s painful, yet such times, I feel live, I adore!<br>Stress pushes me, it’s all I need! This is what life’s for!<br>I’m addicted to these wild seas, I don’t need no shore!<br><br>Or do I?<br>Is this how I want life?<br>Are cursed states my damned fate,<br>Forever with time my strife?<br><br>I do not know.<br>The wounds hurt,<br>But only when the blood flows, do I glow.<br>The knowledge,<br>The decisiveness,<br>The discipline I lack,<br>To choose one path for forevermore.<br><br>But there is one thing I know.<br>I had missed this.</div>
