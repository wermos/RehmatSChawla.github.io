<div class="poem">
<b>Prisoner of my mind</b><br><br>O prisoner of my mind, what raven-song you sing?<br>A mockery, a tragedy, of quests to find my wings<br>You’d have me play the clipper, my company the cage<br>And not satisfy till you have me drowned, in sorrow or in rage<br><br>Imprisoner of my mind, what command you to-day?<br>That I should lash unjustly, or whelm and lifeless stay?<br>That I should starve, insomniate, or sloth my while away?<br>Do what you will, but do to me, drive not my friends astray<br><br>Master of my mind, what lessons do you bring?<br>Tell tales of my fallacies, so hate may seep in<br>I’ll stab me till I’m mastered, so hand me, if not blade,<br>Shards from the mirrors I would shatter to be great</div>
