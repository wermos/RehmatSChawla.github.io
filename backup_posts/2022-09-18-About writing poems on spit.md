<b>About writing poems on spit</b><br><br>Shall we write a poem together<br>About spit, or something else?<br>It would shake someone up<br>Or make people laugh<br><br>It’s better than writing poetry which makes people sad<br>And worried<br>And they say, "Are you alright?"<br>Poems are not written to seek or show reassurances<br><br>Why do you write poems?<br>You say you don’t<br>I find poetry<br>In your steps, in your hair,<br>In the flourish with which you end your signature when the bank won’t be scanning it<br>In the contact names which are so telling, and telling when they are decidedly not<br>You are poetry<br>And I would like to read a part of you<br><br>It is sunset<br>The clouds don’t let me know for sure<br>My phone buzzes<br>You have written down a part of you<br>And despite what I preach<br>I want to ask you<br>Are you alright?<br>And hear something more than the Yes I know will be a lie<br><br>Perhaps<br>We should have written the poem on spit after all<br></div>
