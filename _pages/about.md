Hola<br>
I could introduce myself, but a poem I wrote a few years ago does a better job, so<br>
Enjoy

Heyo, folks of the internet, I’ve got words to say,<br>
Myself Rehmat Singh Chawla, though call me Bread you may,<br>
My branch, it would be EP, my home though, the bookshelf,<br>
Now allow me, words flowing free, to introduce myself!

Incoming!<br>
The volleyball-loving weeb,<br>
Not tricks, just words up his sleeve,<br>
Poetry, rap, stories, you name it, I’m up for it all!<br>
But keep your expectations low, I’m in the amateurs’ hall.

I’ve got no<br>
Favourite story, it’s been so long since I picked one up!<br>
Interesting history, might feel bland, plain milk in a cup!<br>
But words make me feel alive, I jive,<br>
This club’s where I’m gonna thrive!

There’s a bit more to me, I love sweet stuff, and coffee, well,<br>
It’s gotta be a little divine for a drink to shine, froth, and flavour so,<br>
They call it an addiction, I say it’s soothing my soul, or rather,<br>
Exciting, transforming, igniting my psyche of fighting,<br>
Makes me wanna pick up a pen, and start writing!

This is it for now, but it ain’t all, chief.<br>
Five paragraphs this time, next will be six.<br>
Did I seem too arrogant? Sorry, that’s just mischief,<br>
Now I’ve spent way too long on this, back to Physics. 


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
