Hola<br>
I could introduce myself, but a poem I wrote a few years ago does a better job, so<br>
Enjoy

Heyo, folks of the internet, I’ve got words to say,<br>
Myself Rehmat Singh Chawla, though call me Bread you may,<br>
My branch, it would be EP, my home though, the bookshelf,
Now allow me, words flowing free, to introduce myself!

<p>Incoming!</p>
The volleyball-loving weeb,
<p>Not tricks, just words up his sleeve,</p>
Poetry, rap, stories, you name it, I’m up for it all!
But keep your expectations low, I’m in the amateurs’ hall.

I’ve got no
Favourite story, it’s been so long since I picked one up!
Interesting history, might feel bland, plain milk in a cup!
But words make me feel alive, I jive,
This club’s where I’m gonna thrive!

There’s a bit more to me, I love sweet stuff, and coffee, well,
It’s gotta be a little divine for a drink to shine, froth, and flavour so,
They call it an addiction, I say it’s soothing my soul, or rather,
Exciting, transforming, igniting my psyche of fighting,
Makes me wanna pick up a pen, and start writing!

This is it for now, but it ain’t all, chief.
Five paragraphs this time, next will be six.
Did I seem too arrogant? Sorry, that’s just mischief,
Now I’ve spent way too long on this, back to Physics. 


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
