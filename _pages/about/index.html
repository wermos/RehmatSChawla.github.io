I especially enjoy finding connections between different fields, and adapting mathematical and computational techniques across them.<br><br> When not buried in Physics or code, you might find me reading, writing poetry, or brewing coffee. Explore this website for a taste of my life and work!</p> <p></p> <p>&lt;!– Hola<br> I could introduce myself, but a poem I wrote a few years ago does a better job, so<br> Enjoy Heyo, folks of the internet, I’ve got words to say,<br> Myself Rehmat Singh Chawla, though call me Bread you may,<br> My branch, it would be EP, my home though, the bookshelf,<br> Now allow me, words flowing free, to introduce myself! Incoming!<br> The volleyball-loving weeb,<br> Not tricks, just words up his sleeve,<br> Poetry, rap, stories, you name it, I’m up for it all!<br> But keep your expectations low, I’m in the amateurs’ hall. I’ve got no<br> Favourite story, it’s been so long since I picked one up!<br> Interesting history, might feel bland, plain milk in a cup!<br> But words make me feel alive, I jive,<br> This club’s where I’m gonna thrive!</p> <p>There’s a bit more to me, I love sweet stuff, and coffee, well,<br> It’s gotta be a little divine for a drink to shine, froth, and flavour so,<br> They call it an addiction, I say it’s soothing my soul, or rather,<br> Exciting, transforming, igniting my psyche of fighting,<br> Makes me wanna pick up a pen, and start writing!</p> <p>This is it for now, but it ain’t all, chief.<br> Five paragraphs this time, next will be six.<br> Did I seem too arrogant? Sorry, that’s just mischief,<br> Now I’ve spent way too long on this, back to Physics. –&gt;</p> <div class="long-5"> </div> </body></html>
