Hi!

Here's the first of my poems to go up here, one of my favourites, though a little short. Enjoy!


<div class="poem">
<b>Two can make a team</b><br><br>

While the sun yet dreams I stand beneath the cloudy sky,<br>
Beautiful hues of purple and blue as the yawns bring pinches of light,<br>
And I know it sounds cheesy, but I believe in “you and I”,<br>
Together, we could craft in the night something worthy of a sunrise.<br><br>

Darkness, like fog unyielding, blocked my way before,<br>
Perhaps you too, have glimpsed through, only to fail to open the door,<br>
Call it foolish optimism, but I’d bet big on this steed,<br>
I suspect you happen to have a torch, and I the key you need.<br><br>

Now I’m quite full of imperfections, and I trust you have your chinks,<br>
It’ll have to be a balance, one can’t soar if the other sinks,<br>
So I’ll trust you, put faith in me. Across hellish ways lies a dream,<br>
But grab this hand, and I think you’ll find that two can make a team.<br><br>
