<div class="poem">
<b>Strangling lull</b><br><br><br>I feel a lull, serenity, drowsiness,<br>Dull, strangling me, hurts to rest,<br>Jaded, foggy my mind, the stress<br>Of failure pulses beneath my chest.<br><br>Where is the tempest?<br>The rush, the feeling<br>Of wind, of hurtling<br>Through waves, through burdens,<br>It weighed, but purpose, I had,<br>Now aimless, I pray for a map,<br>The fuel tank is leaking, I peer through the cracks,<br>The sun should be bright, but foggy the tracks<br>The air weighs me down, and nought pushes back.<br><br>My dreams still glimmer, but drifting away,<br>The strings they pull me with thin and decay<br>I see an oasis in trusting today,<br>It turns out a mirage and shimmers away.<br>My hope shimmers away.<br><br><br><br>I fumble for lanterns and lights in the dark<br>I clutch on to flint stones, I just need a spark<br>I feel a faint tug, a string becomes taught<br>I push myself up and I begin to walk</div>
