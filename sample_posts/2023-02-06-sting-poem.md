One thing I love is using multiple languages in a single poem. While I'm yet limited by my lack of polyglottism (I'm certain that's not really a word, but then it should be), I do have one attempt at such a poem that's dear to my heart, it was the poem with which I realised I could write meaningful, interesting poems and that I enjoyed it a lot. Presenting,

<div class="poem">
<b>Sometimes you just like the sting</b><br><br>

Hear me out, I'm not a masochist,<br>
I'm not out here advertising eating fists,<br>
Nor hurting yourself for the fun of it,<br>
But the sting, it reminds you you exist.<br><br>

Doesn't it?<br>
Hasn't it,<br>
Ever woken your head and senses?<br>
Snapped, right cracked, stupor you out of,<br>
Wind rushes past, ridding the pillow soft,<br>
Open wide eyes, disappear lies,<br>
like foggy skies with bright sunrise?<br>
Il a pour me, mon ami.<br>
Il a pour me, loving it, je suis.<br><br>

Sometimes you just like the sting.<br>
Because this we know, you and I,<br>
Without the thorns, the petals die;<br>
Alchemy's fundamental law holds true,<br>
As you give to me, I must lose for you,<br>
So when it stings, I know for sure,<br>
That what I'm getting is true, and<br>
My bruises keep wanting more.<br>
So, mon ami, do you see?<br>
Pourquoi c'est comme ça avec me?<br><br>

But before I go, I'll leave you with this,<br>
The sting may be nice, but not memory miss,<br>
A little bruise heals easy, not so the cracks and pains,<br>
Of bones, hearts broken - sometimes never heal again.<br><br>
</div>

Translations:<br>
"il a pour me" = "it has for me"<br>
“mon ami" = "my friend"<br>
"je suis" = "I am"<br>
“pourquoi c'est comme ça avec me?" = "why it is like this with me?"<br>
