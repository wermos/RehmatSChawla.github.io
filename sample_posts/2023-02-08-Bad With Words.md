<b>Bad With Words</b><br><br>Bad with words<br><br>I’m bad with words<br>You may be surprised,<br>A poet claiming he doesn’t know how to write?<br>It’s not so much my vocab, or the grammar being right,<br>But making my words mean what I want them to mean<br>My light-absorbing orbs stare down the blinking line, black on white<br>I can’t tell if I should delete to the left or write to the right<br>Emails not worth minutes have taken me nights<br><br>Emails, yes, that’s where people say they don’t know what to say,<br>But say, you want C to do B by time A,<br>Then so you say, make it a little polite, send and be on your way<br><br>That’s not the hard part, but oh, if I start to say what’s hard I’ll never get anywhere<br>Mostly because I’d stick a TWSS into any conversation I’m near<br>(TWTS?)<br>But also because I’m bad at saying things so that you hear what I want you to hear<br><br>Let me break it down, I suck at conversations, I think too slow and miss my chances,<br>Laugh too much, and when I do empathise I seem unresponsive<br>Unresponsive when asked for opinion or advice,<br>And when I respond I doubt every word I say<br>(Though that’s a story for another day)<br><br>I’ve never added value to conversations, lest I can twist them to myself<br>I talk too much about myself, well<br>It is the only subject I know kinda well<br>But then it comes back to the well of all the ways I’m bad with words<br>To beg for a job you gotta overwhelm and convince them of your worth<br>And I lack the words to make me worth a dwell - or maybe just lack faith in my worth?<br><br>Well, this has been far too many words without much worth<br>You’re welcome to leave now, apologies for keeping you long<br>TWSS<br>Sorry, couldn’t resist<br>Maybe I could have if I had something more worthwhile to say<br>But I’m just that bad with words.<br></div>
