I oft feel a pressure, arising from my own ambitions, to be more productive, more efficient. And so I push myself, sometimes in odd ways, sometimes too harshly. These efforts don't always bear fruit, and this can be discouraging - I realised one day that I needed a paradigm shift in my path of self-improvement.

<div class="poem">
<b>Efficient</b><br><br><br><br>56 things on my to-do list<br>I’ve got the drive, can do it all if I be quick,<br>Might be sleep-deprived, just hold on till the caffeine hits<br>24 are plenty, if I use them fit<br>If I wisely split, if I schedule it,<br>Lost 2 feeling lazy? I can make up for it,<br>Lose nothing,<br>Sacrifice nothing, it’s an art,<br>To use every moment, strategically impart<br>Every second on etching a mark with my metal<br>Impress with intelligence, make up for defects<br>For fissures and scratches that smother my prowess<br>With which every task that I take I still decorate<br><br>And I still decorate every day with failures<br>And I still end days in unchecked boxes and tears<br>And every morning I race the clock, and race my fears<br>And I push every second, but the list grows unsheared<br><br>Every step can be studying, every rest another page,<br>Treat meals like side-quests, a conversation a cage.<br>This is the right way, isn’t it?<br>To make the most of the time that’s given,<br>To strive to be more efficient?<br>Maybe I could be the genius everyone says is wrong!<br>Ah frick, that really is just arrogance.<br><br>An ego too eloquent<br>A mind with no pessimist<br>A focus misplaced,<br>A hope too unmerited<br>And time is yet limited<br>So be slow and rigorous<br>Fix what is broken<br>And you’ll see efficient.<br></div>
