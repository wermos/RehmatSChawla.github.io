I'd been writing the occasional poem for a long time when I discovered rap music, and at first I did not draw a connection between the two. But less than an year later, when I penned my first rap (for a Chemistry assignment, no less), I realised how similar it was to when I used to write poetry. This motivated me to pick up the pen again - more seriously this time - and led to the most bountiful era my poetry has seen.<br>
I've realised that my works often have dual qualities allowing for rap-like readings as well as poetic performances, and I want to explore this further. In response to the occasional dissenting opinions, I composed the following piece - and well, I'll let it speak for itself.

<div class="poem">
<b>Rap and Poetry</b><br><br>Some would like to draw a line between rap and poetry<br>I would like to live where they would dig the pit<br>I’ll straddle the line with devices and disses<br>Hop over it and back like I’m skipping to a beat.<br>My power lies in my pen, and it can’t be taken from me<br>I’ll write lyrical epics and literary rhapsodies,<br>Something which could be sung to a crowd with a beat, or appreciated as an artistic symphony.<br>As interdisciplinary as can be<br>That’s the only way I can ink me.</div>
