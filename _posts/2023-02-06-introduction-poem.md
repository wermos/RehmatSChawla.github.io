Good evening, folks. Another post before I go for a much-needed nap. This is a little poem/rap I wrote to introduce myself in a WhatsApp group concerning the Literary Arts club at my college (Literati). 

<div class="poem">
Heyo, folks of Literati, I’ve got words to say,<br>
Myself Rehmat Singh Chawla, though call me Bread you may,<br>
My branch, it would be EP, my home though, the bookshelf,<br>
Now allow me, words flowing free, to introduce myself!<br><br>

Incoming!<br>
The volleyball-loving weeb,<br>
Not tricks, just words up his sleeve,<br>
Poetry, rap, stories, you name it, I’m up for it all!<br>
But keep your expectations low, I’m in the amateurs’ hall.<br><br>

I’ve got no<br>
Favourite story, it’s been so long since I picked one up!<br>
Interesting history, might feel bland, plain milk in a cup!<br>
But words make me feel alive, I jive,<br>
This club’s where I’m gonna thrive!<br><br>

There’s a bit more to me, I love sweet stuff, and coffee, well,<br>
It’s gotta be a little divine for a drink to shine, froth, and flavour so,<br>
They call it an addiction, I say it’s soothing my soul, or rather,<br>
Exciting, transforming, igniting my psyche of fighting,<br>
Makes me wanna pick up a pen, and start writing!<br><br>

This is it for now, but it ain’t all, chief.<br>
Five paragraphs this time, next will be six.<br>
Did I seem too arrogant? Sorry, that’s just mischief,<br>
Now I’ve spent way too long on this, back to Physics.<br>
</div>
